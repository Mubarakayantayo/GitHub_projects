The most different part of the project is writing out the my malloc in several ways and watching is fail. I also found it hard to think of operations to check if the cunk of memory was used or full. Mentally it made sense but couldn't derive an equation for it
It kind of does only that mine doesn't work like the real deal
It is slightly better and i see the use of storing in multiples of a number like 8 or it's multiples.
